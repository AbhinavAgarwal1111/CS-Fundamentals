What are the different operations on the array?
Arrays allow random access to elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster. Hence operation like searching, insertion, and access becomes really efficient. Array elements can be accessed using the loops.

1. Insertion in Array:
We try to insert a value to a particular array index position, as the array provides random access it can be done easily using the assignment operator.

2. Access elements in Array:
Accessing array elements become extremely important, in order to perform operations on arrays.

3. Searching in Array: 
We try to find a particular value in the array, in order to do that we need to access all the array elements and look for the particular value.
