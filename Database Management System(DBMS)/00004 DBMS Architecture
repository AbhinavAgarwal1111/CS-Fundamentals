DBMS Architecture

A Database store a lot of critical information to access data quickly and securely. Hence it is important to select a correct Architecture for efficient data management.

Types of DBMS Architecture:
1- Tier Architecture:
In One-Tier Architecture the database is directly available to the user, the user can directly sit on the DBMS and use it i.e.; the client, server, 
and the Database are all present on the same machine. For Example- To learn SQL we set up an SQL server and the database on the local system.\
This enables us to directly interact with the relational database and execute operations. 

Two-tier architecture: 
The two-tier architecture is similar to a basic client-server model. The application at the client end directly communicates with the database at the server side. 
APIs like ODBC and JDBC are used for this interaction. The server side is responsible for providing query processing and transaction management functionalities.
On the client side, the user interfaces and application programs are run.
The application on the client side establishes a connection with the server side in order to communicate with the DBMS. 

Three Tier architecture: 
In this type, there is another layer between the client and the server. The client does not directly communicate with the server.
Instead, it interacts with an application server which further communicates with the database system and then the query processing and transaction management takes place.
This intermediate layer acts as a medium for the exchange of partially processed data between server and client.
